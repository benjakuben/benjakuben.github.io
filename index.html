        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>I have led teams as a developer, manager, director, and vice president. My career has shown me that compassionate, involved leadership
          with a focus on trusting and empowering individuals leads to successful teams in terms of career goals and high-quality deliverables. I 
          depend on and believe strongly in processes and documentation that evolve with the team. I strive to create an environment where people
          can create space for deep work and proactive collaboration.</p>
        <p>In terms of software engineering, I have deep experience in mobile development on both 
          Android and iOS, and Iâ€™ve worked on enterprise Java systems, ASP.NET Web APIs, and Python for data analysis. I strive for clean, 
          testable interfaces, well-organized architecture, and clarity of code, especially for maintenance. I have written code in a wide 
          variety of languages, and while I enjoy picking up new languages, frameworks, and tools as needed, my expertise lies in mobile 
          development and I am most proficient in the following:</p>

            <li><b>Tools:</b> GitLab/GitHub, Asana, ADO, Jira, Confluence, Trello, Firebase, Mixpanel</li>
